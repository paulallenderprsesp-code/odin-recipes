Project Recipe Website.

As a complete noob at this it's pretty exciting to finally get to a project and create something from scratch.
I ended up following kevin powell's HTML and CSS for absolute beginners, which was great
and now i am back with The Odin Project.

I'll add more to this when i am done.
